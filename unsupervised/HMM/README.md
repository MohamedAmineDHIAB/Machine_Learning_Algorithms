# Hidden Markov Model:


Here we will try experiment with hidden Markov models, in particular, applying them to modeling character sequences, and analyzing the learned solution. 
The file `hmm.py` contains basic implementation of an HMM and of the Baum-Welch training algorithm. 
The names of variables used in the code and the references to equations are taken from the HMM paper by Rabiner et al.
